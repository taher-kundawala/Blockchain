# Blockchain
Simple Blockchain using Python OOPS concept

This project is part of a capstone project required to complete my certifications in python.

I have used very simple concepts of classes & functions to achieve the results.

The Blockchain uses the concept of 'proof of work' to validate the ledger. I have used Flask to create API to trigger webservices to call different processes of adding new transactions, mining, registering new nodes and validating blockchain ledgers.
